Online Examination Project - Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL
The Online Examination Project is a web-based application developed in Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL, designed to facilitate online exams for educational and training purposes. This project includes essential features to provide a seamless examination experience:

User Authentication: Users can log in securely to access the exam portal, ensuring only authorized individuals can participate.
Profile and Password Management: Users can update their profile details and reset their password, enhancing flexibility and security.
MCQ Answer Selection: During the exam, users can select answers for multiple-choice questions (MCQs), providing a simple interface for managing responses.
Timer and Auto-Submission: The application includes a countdown timer that tracks the duration of the exam. When the timer reaches zero, the exam auto-submits, helping maintain time constraints and reducing human intervention.
Session Management and Logout: Sessions are managed to ensure data consistency, with an option for users to log out securely once they finish.
This project combines essential examination features and user-friendly functionalities, making it ideal for implementing online quizzes, tests, and certification exams.
